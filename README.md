# BRIGHTONY-SUPERMARKET-SALES-REPORT

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of Brightony’s sales performance, focusing on six critical areas: category contributions, sales trends, regional performance, customer demographics, order value, and the effect of discounting on profitability. The analysis reveals robust revenue growth and strong profitability, with Fashion driving the highest profit margins and Electronics leading in sales volume. The South region outperforms all others, while customer insights show that older age groups and male buyers dominate revenue generation. However, overall profit margins remain low, suggesting that discounting and cost structures are constraining profitability. Strategic recommendations are outlined to improve margins, expand market penetration, and enhance customer engagement.

  ### FINDINGS/INSIGHT

##### Product and Category Performance
- Fashion: Highest profitability (₦2.17M profit).
- Electronics: Largest sales volume (₦6.32M) but thinner margins.
- Groceries: Weakest contributor to both sales and profit.
##### Sales Trends Over Time
- Monthly: Stable performance (₦1.1M–₦1.3M).
- Quarterly: Sales peak in Q2 and Q4, reflecting seasonal demand.
- Yearly: Consistent growth, with sales exceeding ₦8M in 2025.
##### Regional Performance
- South: Best-performing region (₦5.6M, 39%).
- East, West, North: Balanced but lower performance (~20% each).
##### Customer Demographics
- Age: Customers aged 60+ dominate sales (₦3.4M).
- Gender: Male customers contribute 56.4%, females 43.6%.
- Cities: Sales distributed evenly across top five cities, minimizing concentration risk.
##### Order Value and CLV
- AOV: ₦2.86K.
- CLV: ₦71.51K, indicating a small but high-value customer base.
##### Impact of Discounts
- Heavy discounting practices appear to suppress overall margins, particularly in Electronics, where high sales do not translate into proportionate profits.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
##### Maximize High-Margin Segments
- Expand Fashion offerings, emphasizing premium collections to sustain profitability.
##### Improve Electronics Profitability
- Reduce discount dependency, implement bundled pricing strategies, and introduce value-added services (e.g., warranties, upgrades).
##### Regional Growth Initiatives
- Strengthen presence in East, West, and North through targeted campaigns, localized marketing, and distribution partnerships.
##### Youth and Gender Engagement
- Develop affordable, trend-driven products for younger customers and tailor marketing campaigns to increase female participation.
##### Customer Loyalty Enhancement
- Introduce structured loyalty programs, personalized offers, and exclusive benefits to maximize lifetime value.
##### Rationalize Discounting Practices
- Adopt a data-driven approach to promotions, ensuring sales uplift without eroding profit margins.
